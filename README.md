## About This Project:
The objective of this project was to create a movie application with #reactjs consuming the TMDB #api
Here I explored several important subjects such as: routes with React Router and React hooks (useState and useEffect)
Also, was created with #vite a very interesting design tool, which is being used in modern projects
In this project I also created a search functionality, where we can find the movies we want, and also an individual page with details about the movies.
